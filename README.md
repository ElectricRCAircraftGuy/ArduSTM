# ArduSTM
Going from Arduino to professional with STM32 microcontrollers.

## Description
Going from nothing to programming microcontrollers is extremely difficult. Arduino makes that possible. Going from Arduino to professional is extremely difficult, my goal is for ArdSTM to make that more possible. 

I'd like to take the spirit of Arduino, which is what got me from not knowing what a microcontroller was in 2012, to now having invented a couple products (including one that helped with filming Hollywood movies) and to finally landing my dream job as an embedded systems software engineer on self-driving trucks at Uber Advanced Technologies Group. Now, I'd like to see if I can give back a little to help others like me--with my drive, dedication, and passion, to do what I've done too. 

I envision ArduSTM being an STM32-based toolkit which provides easy-to-use and easy-to-follow examples, including base source code and libraries, like Arduino does, to quickly get up and running with STM32. STM32 microcontrollers are a beast, and without this tool someone trying to get started with them needs either: several hundred hours and TONS OF RELENTLESS DEDICATION (was essentially my case), a job and peers/mentors to guide them (is now somewhat my case too), or something like this to break it all down and make it possible. Why does it have to be so hard!? Answer: it doesn't. Let's break it down a bit more.

## Approach
We will use the STM32-provided HAL libraries. We will NOT try to become our own thing. We will rely on STM32CubeMX and STM32 examples where it makes sense. We will *teach* how to do what we are doing and what we have done, by providing explanations, example code, tools, and demonstration videos. We will NOT turn away those who want to learn and isolate ourselves to the "experts only." We will embrace others. We will be respectful. We will be mentors ourselves. We will use direct-register-manipulation where it makes sense. We will NOT try to become our own stand-alone thing like Arduino is to AVR and Atmel ARM32. Rather, we will seek to become the stepping stones necessary to give an interested hobbyist the firm footing they need to cross the wide, rapids-filled river until they can begin to do things on their own by:
 # Using our easy-to-use tools and libraries
 # Using the tools and example code provided by STM (ex: HAL and LL libraries, STM32CubeMX, STM32CubeF2/3/4/etc example code, etc)
 # Using direct register manipulation by referencing the Reference Manuals, Application Notes, and other documents provided by STM or ARM
 # Using other resources--either free or commercial, as they see fit. 

Once we have done these things, we can know we are successful. 

Let's make the transition into the world of STM32 and from Arduino to professional a little bit easier.
